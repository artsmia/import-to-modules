# Import to Modules

Provides an API of sorts for importing external data into the website as modules. Could also be used for dynamically creating and populating a modular page.

## Importer Usage

Just go to Tools > Import to Modules (must be a website administrator). Choose the script you'd like to run from the dropdown and hit Go.

## Adding New Scripts

Just dump scripts into the `/import_scripts/` subfolder. 

Any output generated by the script will be displayed beneath the form after the script runs.
